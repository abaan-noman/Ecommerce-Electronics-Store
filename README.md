The Electronic Store GUI Application offers a user-friendly interface for interacting with an electronic store model. Built upon the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, it provides intuitive features for inventory management, sales processing, and an enhanced shopping experience.

At the core of the application lies the graphical user interface (GUI) crafted within a dedicated class. This window maintains a non-resizable layout, ensuring ease of use and intuitive navigation.

Driving the functionality of the application is a controller component, responsible for coordinating interactions between the view and the underlying model. It initializes the store model and manages events seamlessly.

Event handling plays a crucial role in the application, facilitating smooth user interactions. From adding items to the cart to completing sales and updating stock information, the application responds intuitively to user actions, enhancing usability and productivity.

Utilizing Java and JavaFX, users can experience seamless navigation and interaction with the application. JavaFX provides a robust platform for building rich graphical user interfaces, while Java ensures the application's stability and performance.

To use the application, users can simply run the designated class. Interact with the interface using the provided buttons and list views to manage inventory, process sales, and view popular items. For added convenience, a "Reset Store" button is available to reset the model to its initial state.

The application is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for seamless integration of additional features and expansion to accommodate growing user needs and evolving business requirements.
